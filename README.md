# IOFileControl
Repository containing code I wrote that helps programmers manage files in Unity and other C# based IDE's.

The problem this code solves is a simple one: A lot of programmers find it tedious to write code for file control/management, including me, so I created this code to easily incorporate file management into my projects.
